Queue Maintenance
************************************************************************************************************************
Requirements:
    a. MySQL server 5.x installed and configured.
    b. citi and citiuser schemas running onMySQL server.
    c. Java SDK 1.6.0_37
    d. Maven 3.0.x installed.

Installation:
    1. Make sure that “database.properties” file matches your databases configuration.
    2. c.	Also make sure to check “config.properties” file, in order to allow the application, clean TransactionQueue
    table less days before current date. Default value is set to seven, according to requirements document.
    3. After that you should be ready to package the QueueMaintenance. To do it you should go to the terminal console
    and under the folder “queueMaintenance” you must run the following commands:
        - $mvn clean
        - $mvn package
    4.	If execution of the above processes are successful, a “target” folder will be created under
    queueMaintenance folder.
    5.	Assuming you are still on “queueMaintenance” folder run the following command in order to run
    QueueMaintenance:
        - $java –jar target/QueueMaintenance.one-jar.jar
    6. In order to manually package a tarball file for production we must keep the following file structure:
        - queueMaintenance (Folder)
                |
                |__ target (Folder)
                |
                |__ QueueMaintenance.one-jar.jar (Jar file)

       Then you will be able to execute jar file as in previous step:
        - $ java –jar target/QueueMaintenance.one-jar.jar
    7.	At this point QueueMaintenance will delete data from transactionQueueDB. SUCCESS transactions from
    TransactionQueue table and older than a week(assuming default configuration), will be deleted.
